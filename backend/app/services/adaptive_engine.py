SmartInterview — Adaptive Learning Engine (Week 8)

Deterministic decision engine that controls interview progression.
Decides: next skill, Bloom level, difficulty, and question type
based on per-skill performance tracking.

Architecture:
    - LearnerProfile: tracks per-skill performance (attempts, scores, bloom, difficulty)
    - AdaptiveState: serializable session state
    - decide_next(): deterministic rules for progression
    - select_skill(): weakness-biased coverage
    - select_question_type(): Bloom-guided type selection

Adaptive Rules (deterministic):
    Score >= 80  → advance Bloom level (if at max, advance difficulty)
    Score 50–79  → maintain current level
    Score < 50   → regress Bloom level (if at min, lower difficulty if possible)

These rules are implemented in Python — the LLM does NOT decide progression.
